A web-based fleet management system prototype made for National Power Corporation - Mindanao Generation

**Notes:**
- The system runs via **XAMPP** (together with Apache and MySQL), so make sure your system has the program installed.
- A third-party library is used for generating QR codes (PHPQRCode), and the library is located in the [**_/lib_**] folder. The library is compressed, thus it is not functional. Please do make sure to extract the ZIP file on your PC in the same folder to make the library functional.
- The video for the login page is downscaled from 1080p to 480p to mitigate the issue of GitHub not being able to handle files larger than 25MB. (File name: *video-cropped-480p.mp4*)
